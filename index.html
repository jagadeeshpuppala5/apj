    <p class="hlo">Some life stories are not just great but are inspiration stories for the world. Few people die, but their great morals and names never leave the world; APJ Abdul Kalam is one of them. The greatest scientist of India,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam" target="_blank"><strong> Dr APJ Abdul Kalam,</strong></a> was the <strong>former President of India</strong> and played a major role in developing weapon sciences such as missiles and nuclear weapons in India. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam; he was a member of DRDO (Defense Research and Development Organization) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and was named the <strong>"Missile Man of India".</strong></p>

    <p>Inspiration for thousands of students, Abdul Kalam, was honoured with <strong>"Bharat Ratna".</strong> He dedicated his entire life to the field of Science and Technology. Kalam was elected as <i><strong>India's 11th President of India in 2002,</strong></i> and during his entire tenure, he was known as the <i><strong>"People's President".</strong></i> After working as President for 5 years, He went back to the field of Science and took many lectures, met young students, and inspired them. Even when he took his last breath in Shillong at the age of 83, he delivered a lecture at the Indian Institute of Technology Shillong.</p>
    <a id="his" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam#Early_life_and_education" target="blank"><h2>His Early Life</h2></a>
    <p><i>Kalam was born in a low-income family on 15 October 1931 in the Hindu pilgrim centre Pambam Island Rameshwaram, India</i> His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was the holder of a ferryboat that travelled the way between Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi (now an abundant village) and worked as Imam at the local mosque. In contrast, his mom, Ashiamma, was a housewife. They all belonged to a Tamil Muslim family, and Kalam was the youngest among four brothers and one sister.</p>
    <p><i>Kalam's family belonged to a very rich merchant community, "Marakayar Traders", and had rich ancestor</i> Yet, his family loosed their luck by 1920; their trade between two countries, India and Srilanka, was unsuccessful and made them this poor that they had nothing except for their ancestor's home when Kalam was born. At a small age, he had to vend newspapers so that he could help his family in earning. Kalam started going to school in Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram. He was an average student in school but loved studying math and other subjects and had a strong wish to learn.</p>
    <h2 id="coll">His College Life
    </h2>
    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam took admission to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, which was affiliated with Madras University, and graduated in Physics. Later he moved to Madras and took admission to the Madras University of Technology in Aerospace Engineering in 1955. While he was working on the project at the university, his Dean went angry with him and gave him only a 3-day deadline to complete the work that he had done, which made him happy.</p>
    <h2 id="kalam">Kalam as a Scientist</h2>
    <p><i>After completing his degree at the Madras University of Technology in 1960, he joined DRDO in Aeronautics Development Establishment as a scientist. He designed a small aircraft as the first scientific work of his career. Still, as he wasn't satisfied with his job, he also started working in other places like the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, well known Indian Scientist.</i></p>
    <p><i><b>In 1963 Kalam Joined the Indian Space Research Organization as the Project Director of India's First Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), </b>which effectively launched the Rohini Satellite to near-earth orbit in 1980.</i></p>
    <p>In 1965 he started working independently on a rocket project in Defense Research and Development Organization, and after 4 years, he got approval from the government and added more engineers to it. From 1963 to 1964, he went to NASA's Langley Research Centre in Hampton, Virginia. Also, he visited Goddard Space flight centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the wallops flight facility.</p>
    <p><i>In the year 1970, he got an invitation from Raja Ramanna to be the observer of India's First Nuclear Test named Smiling Buddha as the representative of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory even when he wasn't part of its development.</i>In the same year, he directed two projects, <strong>Project Devil</strong> and <strong>Project Valiant,</strong> in which he wanted to build up Missiles with the help of SLV program technology. While developing them, Kalam Faced an issue when Union Cabinet disapproved it. Still, later, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided him with a secret fund for this project which was under Kalam's directorship. Kalam convinced the Union Cabinet that they would hide the true nature of these secret aerospace projects.</p>
    <p>In the years between 1970 - and 1990, Kalam worked to build-up <strong>the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects. They both were successful and powerful projects.</strong> In 1980, he was powerful enough that the Government was ready to initiate an advanced missiles project under his directorship.<i> Later under the direction of Defense minister R.Venkataraman, he started working on <strong>Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP)</strong>with a budget of 3.88 billion as a Chief Executive.</i> Later he took part in the development of many missiles, including <strong>"Agni"</strong> and <strong>"Prithvi",</strong> but a few disliked the project due to the misconduct, price, and taking further time.<i> In July 1992, Kalam became the <strong>Head Scientific Advisor of the Prime Minister </strong>and as well the Secretary of<strong> DRDO </strong>(Defense Research and Development Organization).<strong> He was Chief Project Coordinator </strong>for the Pokhran-II nuclear test, and he got the title of <strong>"Best nuclear scientist"</strong> by the media.</i> Kalam was criticised by the director of the site K Santhanam that the thermonuclear had been a fizzle, and he issued an incorrect report.</p>

    <p>In 2002, Kalam was chosen as the 11th President of India. He was chosen as a candidate for Presidency; he and NDA both were popular and in power at that time; all other candidates backed him, so it was a clear win for him. On 25 July, Kalam moved to Rashtrapati Bhavan after taking the oath.</p>
    <p>As a President, APJ Abdul Kalam made many tough decisions and was loved by people. He also won the label of <i><strong>"People's President".</strong></i> The toughest judgment of his life was when he signed an office of Profit Bill. He was criticised when he accepted the mercy plead of 20 people out of 21, but the one he rejected was guilty of rape. One petition he delayed was of Afzal Guru, who was accused of the December 2001 Parliament Attacks but later in 2014, he was hung. A different argument his decision caught was of striking President's Rule in Bihar in 2005 for a week.</p>
